# gen-fermat
This folder contains Magma code to support the computations in Chapter 8 of my thesis (On some generalized Fermat equations of the form x^2 + y^2n = z^p).

This folder contains the following files (more description is contained within each file):

- asymptotic_constants.m computes explicit constants for irreducibility and dimensions of Hilbert cusp forms for signature (2, 2n, 3p).
- cuspforms_7.m verifies the Hilbert cusp form computation for signature (2, 2n, 21).
- cuspforms_17.m verifies the Hilbert cusp form computations for signature (2m, 2l, 17).
- cuspforms_17_output.txt contains the output of the cuspforms_17.m file.
- irreducibility_17.m carries out the irreducibility computations for signature (2m, 2l, 17).
