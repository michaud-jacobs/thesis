Code to accompany the paper "On some generalized Fermat equations of the form x^2 + y^2n = z^p" by Philippe Michaud-Jacobs.

The paper is available on arXiv here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03908.
The published version of the paper is available here: https://doi.org/10.1112/mtk.12127.

The repository contains the following files (more description is contained within each file).
Each file carries out the necessary computations for the corresponding named results.

- Lemmas_7.2_7.3.m
- Proposition_5.2.m
- Theroem_1.m
- Theorem_3.m

The code in this branch (main) of the repository differs from the version of the code originally associated with the published version of the paper. The code in this branch has been refactored a little, and includes all outputs within the files. If you wish to see the original code, it is available in the original-paper branch at the following link: https://github.com/michaud-jacobs/gen-fermat/tree/original-paper.
