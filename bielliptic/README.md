This folder contains Magma code to support the computations in Chapter 4 of my thesis (Copmuting points on bielliptic modular curves over fixed quadratic fields). All code runs on Magma V2.27-7 (and hopefully on later versions too). All timings refer to computations running on a 2200 MHz AMD Opteron.

This folder contains the following files (more description is contained within each file):

- [bielliptic_models.m](bielliptic_models.m) provides code for computing suitable models for X_0(N) and checking nonsingularity.
- [bielliptic_sieve.m](bielliptic_sieve.m) contains an implementation of the Mordellâ€“Weil sieve used. It contains code to support the computations in the proof of the main theorem of the chapter as well as for the example computations.
- [bielliptic_sieve_output.txt](bielliptic_sieve_output.txt) contains the output of the `bielliptic_sieve.m` file.
- [local_point_comparison.m](local_point_comparison.m) contains computations that use the local point method.
