This folder contains Magma code to support the computations in Chapter 6 of my thesis (Fermat's Last Theorem over real quadratic fields).

This folder contains the following files (more description is contained within each file):

- formal_imm_74.m verifies the formal immersion criterion for X_0(74).
- irreducibility.m verifies part 1 of the irreducibility checks.
- irreducibility_output.txt contains the output of the irreducibility.m file.
- levels.m computes the possible levels N_p for Hilbert newforms.
- levels_output.txt contains the output of the levels.m file.
- modular_parametrisation.py verifies irreducibility using the modular parametrisation map.
- newform_elimination.m carries out the newform elimination checks.
- newform_elimination_output.txt contains the output of the newform_elimination.m file.
- regular_primes.m contains functions for checking if primes are d-regular.
- remaining_cases.m completes the elimination of newform steps.
- remaining_cases_output.txt contains the output of the remaining_cases.m file.
- sieves.m verifies the sieving computations.
