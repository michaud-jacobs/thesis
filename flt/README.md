This folder contains Magma code to support the computations in Chapter 7 of my thesis (Fermat's Last Theorem over real quadratic fields).

This folder contains the following files (more description is contained within each file):

- levels.m computes the possible levels N_p for Hilbert newforms.
- levels_output.txt contains the output of the levels.m file.
- newform_elimination.m carries out the newform elimination checks.
- newform_elimination_output.txt contains the output of the newform_elimination.m file.
- remaining_cases.m completes the elimination of newform steps.
- remaining_cases_output.txt contains the output of the remaining_cases.m file.
