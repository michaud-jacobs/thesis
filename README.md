# thesis

This repository contains Magma code and output files to support the computations in my PhD thesis.

The files are organised into seven folders, each of which corresponds to a chapter in my thesis. The code for each chapter is based on the code accompanying the article to which each chapter corresponds. Each folder contains its own README.md file with a more detailed description of its contents. The folders are as follows:

- [cartan](cartan). Chapter 3. Computations of quadratic points on certain non-split Cartan curves.
- [bielliptic](bielliptic). Chapter 4. Computations of quadratic points on certain bielliptic modular curves.
- [p-isogenies](p-isogenies). Chapter 5. Computations of p-isogenies of elliptic curves defined over quadratic fields.
- [decagonal](decagonal). Chapter 6. Computations involving Thue equations corresponding to small exponents.
- [flt](flt). Chapter 7. Computations for level-lowering and working with Hilbert newforms to study the Fermat equation.
- [gen-fermat](gen-fermat). Chapter 8. Computations for irreducibility and working with Hilbert newforms to study certain generalized Fermat equations.
- [Q-curves](Q-curves). Chapter 9. Computations of Q-curve invariants and elimination of newforms to study certain Lebesgueâ€“Nagell equations.
