# thesis

This repository contains Magma code and output files to support the computations in my PhD thesis.

The files are organised into seven folders, each of which corresponds to a chapter in my thesis. The code for each chapter is based on the code accompanying the article to which each chapter corresponds. Each folder contains its own README.md file with a more detailed description of its contents. The folders are as follows:

- [cartan](cartan). Chapter 3. Computations of quadratic points on certain non-split Cartan curves.
- bielliptic. Chapter 4. Computations of quadratic points on certain bielliptic modular curves.
- p-isogenies. Chapter 5. Computations of p-isogenies of elliptic curves defined over quadratic fields.
- decagonal. Chapter 6. Computations involving Thue equations corresponding to small exponents.
- flt. Chapter 7. Computations for level-lowering and working with Hilbert newforms to study the Fermat equation.
- gen-fermat. Chapter 8. Computations for irreducibility and working with Hilbert newforms to study certain generalized Fermat equations.
- Q-curves. Chapter 9. Computations of Qcurve invariants and elimination of newforms to study certain Lebesgueâ€“Nagell equations.
