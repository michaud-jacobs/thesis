This folder contains Magma code to support the computations in Chapter 6 of my thesis (A unique perfect power decagonal number). All code runs on Magma V2.27-7 (and hopefully on later versions too).

This folder contains the following file (more description is contained within the file):

- [small_vals.m](small_vals.m) solves certain Thue equations corresponding to small exponents.
