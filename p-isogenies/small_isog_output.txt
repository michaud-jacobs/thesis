Magma code output to support the computations in my PhD thesis.

This is the output of the sieve.m file available at:
https://github.com/michaud-jacobs/thesis/blob/main/p-isogenies/small_isog.m

This is the output for the small_isog function loop where we consider
d in [-5] cat [2,3,5,6,7] cat [29,10,79,145,1756,697,1009] cat [47*67*101]
