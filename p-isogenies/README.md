# p-isog-quadratic

This folder contains Magma code to support the computations in Chapter 5 of my thesis (Elliptic curves with p-isogenies over quadratic fields).

This folder contains the following files (more description is contained within each file):

- constant_sig_general.m computes bad constant isogeny signature primes for a given class group exponent.
- constant_sig_specific.m computes bad constant isogeny signature primes for a given quadratic field.
- non_constant_sig.m computes bad non-constant isogeny signature primes for a given quadratic field.
- small_isog_c.m uses modular curves to check for small degree isogenies.
- formal_immersion_mp.m verifies the ranks of certain formal immersion matrices.
