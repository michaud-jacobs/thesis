# p-isog-quadratic

This folder contains Magma code to support the computations in Chapter 5 of my thesis (Elliptic curves with p-isogenies over quadratic fields).

This folder contains the following files (more description is contained within each file):

- General_constant_sig_c.m computes bad constant isogeny signature primes for a given class group exponent.
- Non_constant_sig_c.m computes bad non-constant isogeny signature primes for a given quadratic field.
- Small_isog_c.m uses modular curves to check for small degree isogenies.
- Specific_constant_sig_c.m computes bad constant isogeny signature primes for a given quadratic field.
