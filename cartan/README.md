# quad-cartan
This folder contains Magma code to support the computations in Chapter 3 of my thesis (Quadratic points on non-split Cartan modular curves).

This folder contains the following files (more description is contained within each file):

- eqn_data.m contains equations for models and maps.
- model.m obtains a new model for X_ns(13).
- saturation.m carries out the saturation tests.
- saturation_output.txt contains the output of the saturation.m file.
- sieve.m carries out the sieving step.
- sieve_output.txt contains the output of the sieve.m file.
- Xns11.m contains some calculations for the curve X_ns(11).
