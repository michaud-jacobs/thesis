# Q-curves

This folder contains Magma code to support the computations in Chapter 9 of my thesis (Q-Curves and the Lebesgueâ€“Nagell equation), based on joint work with Michael A. Bennett and Samir Siksek.

This folder contains the following files (more description is contained within each file):

- [Qcurve_checks.m](Qcurve_checks.m) carries out basic checks on the Frey Q-curves.
- [Qcurve_elimination.m](Qcurve_elimination.m) carries out the newform elimination steps.
- [Qcurve_elimination_output.txt](Qcurve_elimination_output.txt) contains the output of the `Qcurve_elimination.m` file.
- [ThueMahlerSolver.m](ThueMahlerSolver.m) (written by A. Gherga and S. Siksek) contains code to solve Thue-Mahler equations.
- [rational_elimination_17.m](rational_elimination_17.m) carries out the elimination steps for q = 17 using the rational Frey curve.
