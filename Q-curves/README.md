This folder contains Magma code to support the computations in Chapter 9 of my thesis (Q-Curves and the Lebesgueâ€“Nagell equation), based on joint work with Michael A Bennett and Samir Siksek.

This folder contains the following files (more description is contained within each file):

- [Qcurve_checks.m](Qcurve_checks.m)
- [Qcurve_elimination.m](Qcurve_elimination.m)
- [Qcurve_elimination_output.txt](Qcurve_elimination_output.txt)
- [ThueMahlerSolver.m](ThueMahlerSolver.m)
- [rational_elimination_17.m](rational_elimination_17.m)
